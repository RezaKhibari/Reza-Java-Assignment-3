# Reza-Java-Assignment-3
for assignment 3 **stockUp** I used these tasks:

1. calculate the networth of the portfolio.                                See the section on [`code`](/stockUp/objects/Portfolio.java) lines **75** to **85**
2. fix/improve all PRINT statements! (with color as well, research)        See the section on [`code`](/stockUp/utility/Ink.java) 
3. sell a stock from your portfolio (balance and networth should update).  See the section on [`code`](/stockUp/objects/Portfolio.java) lines **60** to **72**
